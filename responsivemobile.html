        <p> examples: </p>
        <code> @media (max-width: 768px){} /*768 and smaller (most tablets)*/ </code>
                <br>
        <code>@media (min-width: 769px) {} /* larger than 768px (most landscape tablets and computers*/)</code>

        <code>@media (min-width: 800px) and (max-width:1200px){} </code>

        <h2>Media query berst practices</h2>
        <p>try not to use too many madia Queries, combine the othe ones that are close in size, try not to get fixated
            on specific screen size, focus on a break point when required </p>
